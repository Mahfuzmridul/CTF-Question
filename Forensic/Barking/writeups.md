# 🤖Let's solve the problem step by step. 
## 🎗️It's a very basic forensic challenge. When solving CTF challenges we must focus on the problem name and it's description. 
### 🎪Let's read the problem's description carefully. Here, in the description it is said that it's a "strange" file and talking about file's *"head"*. And there the word *"fix"* refers that the header of the file has to be fixed. If we do this, it's not finished there, we have to do something more to get the flag. <br>
