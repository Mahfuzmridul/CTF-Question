## 🔖 Here a text file is given. Let's look through it.

## 1. First run ***file*** command on it: <br> <br>

Looks like normal text file.

## 2. ***Cat*** the file and see what it contains: <br> <br>

Too many gaps.

## 3. Let's open it on a text editor ( I am using ***Sublime***):
### If we select all the text, too many dots and lines are seen, these represent extra spaces and tabs. Those are called ***Whitespaces***. Also in the text we will see whitespaces hint is given. <br> <br>

### 🕷️Now if we search on online we can see that there is a tool called [***Stegsnow***](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/stegsnow.1.html) , which is used to see the hidden text under the whitespaces. And it also requires a password. For the password let's read the text carefully.<br><br>

## 🔎So the password might be : "secretpass"

## 🏆Now use Stegsnow with the password and file which will reveal the flag:<br><br>
