Hidden in words, a mystery at last,		  	  	  
A key to unlock what’s stuck in the past.	     	  	  	     
Some search too hard, some search too fast,  	       	  	 	 
But all that you need is secretpass. 	    	     	       	      
	    	 	      	    	      	     	   	    	    
	    	       	      		  	    	   	     	       
       	 	   	      	     	      			      	       
     	     	  	    		       	   	   	      	     
      	 	 		  	       	      	  	   	  
Whispers in spaces, so empty, so white,  	 	  	       	   
Yet hiding a secret, concealed from sight.
No need to guess, no need to ask,
Just type it in—secretpass!





Snow hides the truth in a silent disguise,
Only the clever will see through the lies.
Tabs and spaces, a digital mass,
But look real close—it’s secretpass!







No magic, no tricks, just knowledge to gain,
And now you are free from the puzzle’s chain.
